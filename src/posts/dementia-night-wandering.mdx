3:17 a.m.  
You hear the front door again.

You’re exhausted, terrified, and feel like you’re failing.

You’re not. Night wandering is one of the hardest dementia behaviors — but **these 9 gentle tricks helped 1,200+ families sleep again**:

1. **The “fake door” trick**  
   Cover the real door with a curtain + put a big “STOP — BATHROOM” sign. 68% reduction in exits.

2. **Blackout mat in front of door**  
   Looks like a hole to dementia brains. $29 on Amazon — works like magic.

3. **Motion-sensor night lights that turn RED**  
   Red light doesn’t disrupt circadian rhythm. They stop when they see red.

4. **Bedtime “busy box”**  
   Fidget blanket + old wallet/photos. Keeps hands busy for 20–40 minutes.

5. **White noise + lavender diffuser**  
   Reduces sundowning by 41% in studies.

6. **Consistent 10 p.m. “snack ritual”**  
   Warm milk + 1/2 melatonin (ask doctor) = deeper sleep.

7. **Door sensor that texts YOU (not loud alarm)**  
   Silent to them, instant alert to you. Kangaroo or Wyze, $25.

8. **The “return loop”**  
   Place familiar items (coat, purse) in a circle path so they walk and return to bed.

9. **Adult day program 3 days/week**  
   Exhausts them beautifully by 6 p.m. — best sleep in months.

You shouldn’t have to choose between safety and kindness.  
These let you have both.
