You’re crying in the bathroom again.  
Or you just stared at the wall for 20 minutes and called it “resting.”  
That’s not laziness. That’s burnout — and 63% of family caregivers experience it severely.

Here are the **7 signs most people ignore until it’s too late**:

1. **You feel resentment — even for a second**  
   You love them… but sometimes you wish you could just walk away. That guilt? Classic burnout.

2. **Your body hurts everywhere**  
   Shoulders locked, jaw clenched, headaches every day. Your body is screaming what your mouth won’t say.

3. **You fantasize about “escaping”**  
   Not forever. Just… a hotel room. Alone. For one night. That thought keeps you sane.

4. **Everything feels heavy**  
   Even making a sandwich feels like climbing a mountain.

5. **You’re angry at everyone**  
   The doctor who’s late. Your sibling who “helps” once a year. The dog for existing.

6. **You’ve stopped doing things you love**  
   Reading, walking, calling friends — all gone. Caring is your entire personality now.

7. **You secretly hope they fall asleep early**  
   So you can finally breathe.

If you nodded at 3 or more — you’re not failing. You’re human.

### 5 things you can do TONIGHT (takes 12 minutes total)

1. **Text one person**: “I’m struggling. Can we talk tomorrow?”  
   Just sending it lifts 10 lbs off your chest.

2. **Set a “caregiver curfew”**  
   After 8 pm, the house can survive without you for 30 minutes. Lock your bedroom door if you have to.

3. **Do the 4-7-8 breath** (90 seconds)  
   Inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8. Do it 4 times. Proven to drop cortisol fast.

4. **Write tomorrow’s top 3 tasks on a sticky note**  
   Then close the notebook. Brain stops spinning.

5. **Drink a full glass of water and say out loud**:  
   “I did enough today.”

You are allowed to rest.  
You are allowed to struggle.  
You are allowed to need help.
